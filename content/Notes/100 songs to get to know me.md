I was browsing through the blog posts of [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) and came across a their [discovery](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) page to find a post [100 songs to get to know me](https://tbskyen.bearblog.dev/100-songs-to-get-to-know-me/) . 

I want to do this when I get some time. 
- I'll clear my Spotify likes section. 
- I'll keep liking the songs that I absolutely love and crave for. 
- Once I reach 100 songs, I'll make a blog post out of it with a little description for each song. 

> [!Note] I can actually share this post with new people I meet. Helps them know a lot about me as well.
