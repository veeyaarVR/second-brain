>[!NOTE] "We Make Shitty Software... With Bugs!" It makes me laugh! We never ran this slogan in an ad. People wouldn't understand. But it's the truth. We make shitty software. And so do you!

>[!NOTE] Talking with an unhappy customer, first validate their belief that you've let them down. I agree that our software isn't perfect. You won't get an argument here. Let's move on, find a workaround, a way to get your data back. And we promise to take a look at this problem and, if possible, fix it in the next release.

I should write about awesome internet people are and how finding one post will help you find a lot of information in a loop and how grateful we should be about internet and its capabilities. 

I came across this post [[We make shitty software so do you]] where it points to a different post named [We make shitty software](http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html) written in 1995 which is profound, straight to the point and relevant even in 2024.
