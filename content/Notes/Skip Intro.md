I feel like I am stuck in the intro part of my life. The intro video to a game which introduces the character, and explaining why he wants to win in his life. Or a trope-to-win the life kinda movie, where the intro scenes are filled with protagonist struggling in his life to meet his needs. I feel like I am stuck in such intro sequence for a very long time.  
  
Am I stuck in the intro of a life changing movie? Or am I midway in a movie where the entire plot is spiralling down towards a tragic ending? You know in some movies, they show how one small decision that the protagonist takes, completely alters his life to a downfall. Have I already taken that decision and not being aware of it? I wish there is a **SKIP Intro** button to my life, so I can skip and reach a point where the path to success actually starts.
