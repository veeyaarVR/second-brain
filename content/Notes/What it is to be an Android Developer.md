Ever wondered what it is to be an Android Developer or any software developer in this case? To create something out of nowhere, thinking of every little possibility and scenarios while adding a feature, solving problems that a random guy from another corner of the world facing that is happening only to him. To be able to have control over each steps during the building process, taking careful calculated steps to solve problems, to try and fail and retry and iterating solutions to provide the best of all.
