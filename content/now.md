I am currently serving my notice period in the company I have been working with for past 5 years. I am also building my long time side project "Marked". More on this soon. I am also thinking of building this mobile app in public so that I can gain audience while building. 

To do that I obviously need to revive my almost dead [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjFwZ-SEMK5k-i24VzRu0w) and I fear I might remind the existing 400-ish users about the channel that they subscribed 3 years ago. 

I also should start learning all the fundamentals in Native Android and DSA as well. I feel a bit insecure and lost my confidence on these topics. I should put this time and effort to get stronger on these.
